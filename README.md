# KAIST SoC CPLab Helpdesk

Here is the helpdesk of the [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr) at
KAIST School of Computing. We will try to answer your questions as far as we can!


## Specialty

We have expertise on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), and
concurrent programming.

To study Rust, we strongly recommend you to start with ["the
book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The entire book is worth reading. Read the book, implement
some Rust code on your own, and ask any questions you've got to have.

To study Coq, we strongly recommend you to start with [Software
Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/). Download the zipped files, unzip them,
upload it to your own Git repository, and start reading the book. Or you can clone [this
mirror](https://github.com/kaist-cp/software-foundations). Don't skip the exercises---they are the
essence of the book.

To study concurrent programming, we strongly recommend you to take [KAIST SoC CS492A: Concurrent
Programming](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs492-concur).


## How to ask questions?

Please search for the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/helpdesk/issues) and see if your
question is already answered. If not, ask your question in the issue tracker.

The content should be clear enough so that we can easily help you. Don't ask the solutions to the
exercises. Don't upload images of codes. Format your content using [GitHub's Markdown
manual](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Especially pay attention to
properly formatting `code`.


## Please contribute to the community

Your participation would be greatly appreciated. Please watch this repository, and if there are some
questions you can answer, please do so. Your help will make the helpdesk much more scalable.
